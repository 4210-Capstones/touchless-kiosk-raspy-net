# Current Pod: <8> – SCRUM

## Usage
The SCRUM team collaborated and coordinated with SWENG’s Fall 2024 class in order to implement a MVP Build. 

The MVP Build began on November 12, 2024, and ended on December 10, 2024. Over the course of a one-month period, all pods were given their task based on updates shared at each class meeting. 

Listed below are the sprints update documented by the Documentation Team: Pod 2:
* [Sprint 1 Progress](https://github.com/4210-Capstones/touchless-kiosk-raspy-net/blob/main/docs/capstone/Sprint1-ProgressReport.md)
