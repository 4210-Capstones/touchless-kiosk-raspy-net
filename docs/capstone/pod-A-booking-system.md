# Current Pod: A â€“ Booking System


## Usage
The booking system allows users to book a room in the Math Building for a maximum of four hours. The system uses python's built in datetime library to manage bookings. The only user interface currently implemented is the discord bot.


## Installation

The code has not been tested on a raspberry PI. Currently using anaconda as a virtual enviroment but should migrate to .venv or docker.


### Dependecies

* anaconda
* python 3.12 or higher
* pip (python package manager)
* discord.py
* python-dotenv


### Setup

1. Install anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download

2. Open a new terminal session and create a new anaconda enviroment.
```
conda create --name [NAME OF ENVIROMENT] python=3.12
```

3. Activate the anaconda enviroment
```
conda activate [NAME OF ENVIROMENT]
```

4. Install discord.py through pip
```
pip install discord
```

5. Install python-dotenv through pip
```
pip install python-dotenv
```

6. Download discord-bot folder

7. Inside discord-bot create a file called .env and inside .env insert your discord api token (Dr. Holmberg should have the discord api token:
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=[INSERT YOUR DISCORD API TOKEN]
```

8. Everything should be set up now. Run the application
```
python main.py
```

9. The SWAMP bot should be online in the CS server and the SWE lab

## Suggestions/comments

### Project Format

* The system was tried to be made be as modular as possible. It is split up into cogs, classes and database.
	* cogs: This folder handles the discord interface
	* classes: This folder contains general python classes
	* database: This folder contains code pertaining to the sqlite server

### IMPORTANT TASK

* The sqlite database should be removed and instead the system should be connected to the main database through API's
* API's have been made but they are flask APIS not fast APIS.
* A kiosk GUI interface needs to be made using tkinter

### Minor Tasks

* The system should be reworked using pytz. Currently the date time is being manually converted from UTC to CDT/CST. pytz can be added to python's built in datetime library.

### Misc.

* users.json contains every current student enrolled in Software Engineering Discord ID. Only accounts inside users.json are authorized to use the discord bot. (We did this since the bot is inside the main CS server and still needs testing)
