## Week 3 Progress

# To-Do: 
MVP is still in progress. 
- need form to go to server
- need admin view to view submissions
- move completed tasks from to-do to completed.
- have submission form connected to web server.
- need more teams on the back-end
- custom views, approving submitting images for client to have access, approval process.
- We have a server and database now we now end user display.
- Browser style application - send new updates to server -> server does approvals.
- Make sure github projects page, client side tasks and research page ai to completed, assign two new tasks.
- Pod C, image management, working demo completed, slideshow, roadblock images are not showing correctly, images stored on local computer, need to have it stored elsewhere, need to collaborate with API team to manage images for web server.
- Web server should be gateway for all requests. Manage data from there.
- Integrate everything together, get together so they co-exist.

- We have leap windowing system - data from windowing system is locally hosted (mock data) data needs send request from web server to get the data, need to re-factor. Need to get real data - will give main view that displays to kiosks. 
- Web server will need to support request from client, communicate with API team to let them know what data you need to get to create API endpoints. Allow client kiosks to communicate with server kiosks.

- Mock data in database
- Populate database with more mock data with clubs, images, etc. rest endpoints needed to get delivered to client side.
- Make calls to web server and get expected output.

- Have login system built:
- now needs to have an adminstrative power: needs to be able to create new admin accounts, manage submission forms
- submission forms are created, need a view to see what options are, any pending forms need to be able to get approved, once approved show images on client side.
