## Summary: 
Accomplishments
- Key developments: Successfully built core functionalities like a request form using Flask, MVP documentation, and a Discord bot for the booking system.
- UI & Infrastructure: Advanced the design of a GUI dashboard, added a new API repository, and integrated backend improvements.
- Collaborations: Initiated library system mock-ups, established partnerships across pods, and explored database and image management strategies.

Ongoing Tasks
- Feature Enhancements: Finalizing tutoring schedules, integrating Leap Motion capabilities, and completing swiping functionality research.
- Infrastructure Upgrades: Designing database tables with SQLAlchemy and Postgres while improving resource accessibility for students.
- Collaborations: Strengthening inter-pod efforts on booking systems, video support for UI, and resource-sharing platforms.

## Accomplished Tasks: 
<u> Pod 1 (Request Form): <u> 
- Jason developed a request form using Flask (backend) and HTML (frontend).
- Data from the form is saved on the server side ((python server, local host) to a CSV file, and uploaded images are stored locally.
- https://github.com/jasonBuras/skunkworks

<u> Pod 2 and 8 (Documentation): <u>
- Completed MVP documentation and Week 1 updates.

<u> Pod 6 (GUI Dashboard, UI Research / UNOPartners): <u> 
- Decided UI can include past research, current research, videos, design of the modules of various partners (backend).

<u> Pod 9 (API and Auth/Role Management): <u> 
- Added a new repository to the server.

<u> Pod A (Booking System): <u> 
- Created a Discord bot (low priority).
- Explored library system mock-ups for booking (collaborating with Pod 3 on priority queue).
- Feedback suggests switching from SQLite to MySQL.
 
  ## Ongoing Tasks:
<u> Pod 3 (Tutoring): <u>
- Developing tutoring schedules, calendars, and updates.

<u> Pod 4 (Database): <u>
- Brainstorming required database tables; considering SQLAlchemy with Postgres.

<u> Pod 5 (Leap Motion): <u>
- Waiting on the installation of new memory cards (finding them + setting them up).
- Research in progress for swiping functionality.
- Mitchell is  working on the 3D printing camera stands.

<u> Pod 7 (Windows UI): <u>
- Initiated software using Tkinter (basic setup).
- Working to integrate Leap Motion functionality into the UI.

<u> Pod A (Booking): <u> 
- Coding in progress (Justin).
- Research by Zoe and Mo continues.
- Coordinating with Pod 4.

<u> Pod B (General Resources): <u>
- Researching ways to provide UNO students with campus resource information (e.g., CSCI building resources).

<u> Pod C (Image/Slideshow): <u>
- Researching Python for image management and developing a slideshow strategy.
- Coordination with Pods 6 and 7 for video support.
