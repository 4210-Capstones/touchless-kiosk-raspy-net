## Suggestions/comments (optional)

To further build upon existing features, here are future implementation suggestions:

1. **Connect backend functionalities to a working frontend**
    - Collaborate with a UI team to design and implement an intuitive frontend.
    - Ensure seamless integration and improvement of existing API
2. **Develop a uniform scheduling system with other systems**
    - Simplify scheduling across services, like with room booking
    - Can integrate features like conflict detection, recurring session, time-slot filtering?
3. **Create QR Code for easy tutoring signup**
    - Generate QR code linking to a signup page
    - Display QR code on screen or at kiosk 
4. **Live Display Design**
    - Display live tutoring schedule on screens in common areas or outside of tutoring rooms
    - Include real-time queue system next to the live schedule where students can join and check availability.
    - Place QR code probably in the bottom-left corner of the screen. 
5. **Comments**
    - For any future tasks, it's good to consider how it might be utilized by faculty, students, and tutors to ensure wide usability and impact.
