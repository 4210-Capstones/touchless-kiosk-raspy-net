# Current Pod: <8> – SCRUMM

## Usage
The SCRUMM team collaborated and coordinated with SWENG’s Fall 2024 class in order to implement a MVP Build. 

The MVP Build began on November 14, 2024, and ended on December 10, 2024. Each week, all pods were given their task based on updates shared at each class meeting.
