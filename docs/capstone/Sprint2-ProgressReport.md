  Ongoing Tasks: 
  - Enhancements: Refining the request form with tagging and calendar systems, improving Leap Motion distance mapping, and adding tutor system database features.
  - Collaborations: Strengthening inter-pod efforts for API, database, and Leap Motion integrations.
  - Documentation: Finalizing Week 2 documentation to capture updates and progress.

## Accomplishments: 
  <u> Pod 1 (Request Form): <u>
  - Polished the request form to allow users to submit images successfully.
  - Discussed adding interactive elements, tagging systems, and advertisement durations.
  - Coordinated with Pod 4 and Pod A for image retrieval and calendar systems.
  - Enhanced request form with image submission, demo available: https://4210-capstones.github.io/touchless-kiosk-raspy-net/
  
  <u> Pod 3 (Tutor System): <u>
  - Implemented GET and POST methods for image retrieval and storage.
  
  <u> Pod 4 & 9 (API and Database): <u>
  - Built databases with Python and SQLAlchemy for roles and users.
  - Created a server repository.
  - Pod 9: Pushed an authentication system to the server repository.
  
  <u> pod 5 (Leap Motion): <u>
  - Demonstrated clickable interaction using pinching and mouse input.
  
  <u> pod 6 (GUI Dashboard): <u>
  - Developed a basic Windows UI (including images) with Leap Motion integration using Tkinter.
  - Shared demo with Pod 5, of the GUI: shows the leap motion integration.
  - Mocked up UI for UNO partners and research but lacks hardcoded student/faculty information.
  
  <u> pod 7 (Window-System UI): <u>
  - Created a basic Windows UI with image support (scaling issues persist).
  - Demoed functionality and design in class.
  
  <u> pod A (Booking System): <u>
  - Updated booking system that uses calendar, date, & time. Collaborated with Pod 4.
  
  <u> pod C (Image Management): <u>
  - Creation of folder to take images and hosting.
  - Used JSON file for set duration date of when images are expired + updates.

## Ongoing Tasks:
  <u> Pod 1 (Request Form): <u>
  - Adding a tagging system for request categorization and calendar integration for image durations.
  - Collaborating with Pod C on webpage-to-server pipelines for touchless kiosks.
  
  <u> Pod 2 (Documentation): <u>
  - Completing Week 2 documentation by the week's end.
  
  <u> pod 4 & 9 (API and Database): <u>
  - Building APIs and refining database structure for booking and image management.
  - Collaborating with Pod 1 for request form data and Pod A for booking enhancements.
  - Ability to create users with email/password and authenticate.
  
  <u> pod 5 (Leap Motion): <u>
  - Continuing to map camera-screen-motion distances and integrate with Raspberry Pi.

  <u> Pod 6 (GUI Dashboard): <u> 
  - Exploring alternatives like Flutter for GUI uniformity and better functionality.
  - Adding student and faculty information and enhancing Leap Motion integration.

## Next Steps: 
- Tagging System (Pod 1): Implement request categorization with duration features.
- Tutor System (Pod 3): Add database support for tutor records and scheduling.
- Leap Motion (Pod 5): Complete distance mapping and hardware integration.
- GUI Improvements (Pod 6): Refine interface design and integrate Leap Motion.
- Collaborations: Strengthen coordination among Pods 4, 5, 6, 7, and C for seamless system integration.
