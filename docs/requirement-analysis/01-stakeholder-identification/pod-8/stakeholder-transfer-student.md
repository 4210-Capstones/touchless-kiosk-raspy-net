# Stakeholder Analysis 

## Stakeholder: Transfer Student 

**Role**: Transfer students are typically upperclassmen adjusting to UNO’s campus.  

**Needs**: Transfer students may need help finding academic resources like advising, open opportunities, and available organizations.  

**Pain Points**: Having not been at the university for very long, transfer students may struggle to understand the process of registering for classes, have trouble connecting with classmates, developing relationships with their instructors, or navigating campus. 

**Desired Outcomes**: A system that gives transfer students easy access to a directory of instructors and academic advisors, club events announcements, the tutoring schedule, and a map of the building.  

### User Stories 

As a transfer student, I want to be able to see the CSCI department’s course catalog to sign-up for classes.
