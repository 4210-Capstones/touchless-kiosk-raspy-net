# Stakeholder Analysis: 
 


## Stakeholder: **Incoming CS Student**
 
**Role**: 
- Incoming CS students are responsible for informing themselves about ins and outs of the department. They would find it very beneficial getting daily news about clubs, tutoring opportunities, etc that occur throughout the facility. 
 
 
**Needs**: 
- Incoming CS students need to know new various announcements that occur daily throughout the CS department. A kiosk would be an excellent way to deliver information to new uninformed students. It would be a great opportunity to get the word out so the new CS students can get involved in different clubs.  
 
 
**Pain Points**: 
- Incoming CS students rely on emails for any sort of announcements. For new incoming cs students that don’t usually check emails, this could lead to a loss of information. A kiosk would be a great chance for incoming cs students to navigate the department and become informed. 
 
 
**Desired Outcomes**: 
- The goal is to provide an easy way for new incoming CS students to discover information about the department. That could include clubs, various classes, internship opportunities and explain what the capabilities of the computer science department.
