## Stakeholder: Faculty
- **Role**: Faculty members and workers are responsible for teaching courses, providing materials, office hours and other services. This role extends to IT personnel, tutors, or even building management.

- **Needs**: These stakeholders would like the ability to access and update various materials that would prove useful for the students enrolled in their courses. Faculty could even use this system to reserve rooms, request equipment, etc.

- **Pain Points**: As of now, Faculty members have to rely on Canvas messaging or email to get their messages out to their classes. This can lead to longer communication and in turn not utilizing everyone's time!

- **Desired Outcomes**: 
	-A system that allows all Faculty members to release their relevant course materials, meeting times and locations. 
	-A system that allows its users to make more educated decisions and plan their time just a little better. 
	-Bonus: A system that helps bring us together as a community.
	-Bonus: A system that shows it can be fun and useful.
