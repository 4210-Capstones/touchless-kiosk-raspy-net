## Stakeholder: Students
- **Role**: Students serve as the life and body of the university. They are necessary in filling the university with a purpose and pride. A healthy, well-informed, and communicative student body means a healthy university. This includes both current students and prospective students. 

- **Needs**: Students as stakeholders consistently need reliable ways to access information relevant to them wherever they are as conveniently as possible, as well as communicate with each other about events or clubs they might be hosting.

- **Pain Points**: Information for various things relating to courses, clubs, or other miscellaneous opportunities that might be important to many students, current or not, especially in the computer science department, are scattered in many different inconvenient locations. A common source for anything a passing student might need may serve as a point to better this predicament. 

- **Desired Outcomes**: 
	-A system that provides easy-to-access information to students about their classes.
	-A system that makes students able to post/view information about clubs and internship opportunities. 
	-Bonus: A system that can show off what the computer science department can do.
