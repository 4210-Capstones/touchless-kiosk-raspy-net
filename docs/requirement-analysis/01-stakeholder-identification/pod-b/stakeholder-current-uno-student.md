## Current UNO Student

### Our Analysis

While the kiosk is intended mainly for CSCI students, let's remind ourselves that these aren't just CSCI students, but also UNO students, and many current UNO students might know their way around campus, but a majority of them are unknowingly ignorant of the number of resources they truly have as UNO students.

### Our Goals

UNO students, whether CSCI students or whichever student happens to pass by the kiosk, will be able to see a "General Resources" section. This section will provide information on resources available to any UNO student on campus, whether it's something important like access to mental health resources or the campus' food bank, or something niche like resume reviews provided to students on campus.
