# Stakeholder: CS Student

**Role**: The CS student is a frequent user of the university’s digital platforms, needing streamlined access to technical resources, research tools, and course-related information to succeed in a rigorous and fast-paced academic environment.

## Needs:
- Access to coding labs and software environments.
- Timely updates on course materials, assignments, and deadlines.
- Efficient navigation to research labs, computer labs, and lecture halls.
- Collaborative tools to connect with peers for project-based courses.
- Seamless integration with online platforms for coding projects, version control, and cloud storage.
- Real-time access to server statuses, especially for CS projects.
- Appointment booking with faculty for consultations and research discussions.
- A centralized hub for research papers, technical reports, and academic journals.
- Constant updates on relevant tech events, hackathons, and guest lectures.
- Remote access to campus services, announcements, and cloud labs.

## Pain Points:
- Difficulty finding available coding labs or computing resources.
- Lack of real-time updates for server statuses or access to essential tools.
- Challenges in coordinating group work and project collaboration remotely.
