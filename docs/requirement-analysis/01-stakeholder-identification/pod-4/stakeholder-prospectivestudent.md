# Stakeholder Analysis: 

## Stakeholder: Prospective Student 

**Role**: Prospective Students are graduating high school students, potential transfer students from other colleges, and other individuals who may be contemplating enrollment at this university. 

**Needs**: Prospective Students need to decide whether a school, and more specifically, a degree program at a school, is a good fit for them. They would want relevant information regarding the various course offerings and the total coursework required to complete the degree. Additionally, they may want to know how successful the university is at preparing its students for gainful employment by examining the workplace placements of its graduates. 

**Pain Points**: It may be challenging for prospective students to gather information on the success of a university’s alumni in the workplace.  And for some prospective students, foraging through a university’s website for specific information related to a degree program could be akin to an easter egg hunt. 

**Desired Outcomes**: The kiosk could provide a clear and prominent link for Prospective Students so that information geared towards their needs is at their fingertips.
