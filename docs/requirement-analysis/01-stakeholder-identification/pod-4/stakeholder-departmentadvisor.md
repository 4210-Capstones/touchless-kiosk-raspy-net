# Stakeholder Analysis: 

## Stakeholder: Department Advisor 

**Role**: Department advisors assist students with course selections, academic planning, and career guidance, while also managing student records and departmental information. 

**Needs**: Advisors need the ability to communicate important deadlines, provide up-to-date information on course offerings, and allow students to easily schedule advising appointments through the kiosk. 

**Pain Points**: Advisors currently rely on emails and in-person meetings to communicate critical information, which may lead to missed appointments or delays in responses. Managing a large number of student requests can be time-consuming. 

**Desired Outcomes**: A system that allows advisors to post announcements, set availability for appointments, and provide students with real-time access to academic resources. Integration with student schedules and the ability to send reminders would streamline advising processes. 

### User Story: 

“As a department advisor, I want to provide students with academic advising resources via the kiosk so that they can access important guidance without scheduling a meeting.”
