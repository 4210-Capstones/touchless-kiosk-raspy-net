# Stakeholder Analysis: 

## Stakeholder: Visitor on Campus 

**Role**: Visitors may come to campus for tours, events, meetings, or general exploration. They need easy access to information about the campus and its facilities. 

**Needs**: Visitors need to find directions, event details, building locations, and contact information for campus departments quickly and efficiently. 

**Pain Points**: Visitors often have difficulty navigating the campus without guidance, and printed maps or signage may be outdated or hard to find. 

**Desired Outcomes**: A system that provides clear, real-time campus maps, event information, and contact details to help visitors navigate the campus with ease. The kiosk should also offer multi-language support and accessibility features.
