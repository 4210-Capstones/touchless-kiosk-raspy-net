# Stakeholder Analysis: 

## Stakeholder: Tutor 

**Role**: Tutors provide academic assistance to students, either in specific subjects or general study skills. They often schedule sessions and need access to school resources. 

**Needs**: Tutors need a way to quickly check and update their availability, confirm tutoring session locations, and access student appointments. 

**Pain Points**: Scheduling conflicts and location confusion are common issues, and tutors often rely on students to communicate these details. It can be difficult to manage bookings efficiently. 

**Desired Outcomes**: A system that allows tutors to update their availability, manage bookings, and provide students with clear session locations. Integration with student schedules and notifications would improve session coordination. 

### User Story: 

“As a tutor, I would like to have access to a survey of the hardest courses in the computer science program as ranked by the students so that I can proactively canvas those classes for students that may benefit from early tutoring intervention.” 

“As a tutor, I want to be able to compile a list of students who came to tutoring so that it can be easily viewable.”
