Why is this system needed?
Enables the ability to interact with an information hub that adds departmental cohesion and potentially to showcase not just the product of this project, but also individual student projects. 

What problems does it solve? 
The problem this solves is the vacuum of interaction which exists in the hall media televisions. They are sufficient in providing information, but as students of computer science, we should encourage the pursuit of creative and practical programming. Additionally, we could add to the achievements of our C.S department by showcasing our own interactive projects with the kiosk. 

How will it benefit users and the organization? 
The interactive kiosk will facilitate communication, open doors for new studentâ€“led development, and might even encourage the CSCI student body to venture past the curriculum and take the initiative to work on their own software applications for it and allow them to be displayed somewhere even if they are not relevant to the kiosk itself

"As a student, I want to see a map of the building so that I can easily find my classrooms or professor's office."
"As a student, I want to sign up for study group sessions via the kiosk so that I can collaborate with classmates outside of class."
