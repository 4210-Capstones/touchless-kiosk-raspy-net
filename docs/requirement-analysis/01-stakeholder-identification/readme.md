# Stakeholder Identification (Part 1)

## Overview

This document outlines the tasks and expectations for Part 1 of the **Capstone Project: Stakeholder Identification**. In this phase, each pod will focus on identifying relevant stakeholders for the touchless kiosk system and creating initial user stories that will guide the subsequent requirements analysis.

For detailed instructions, you can access the full Cycle 0 document [here](https://github.com/4210-Capstones/4210-course-resources/blob/main/Capstone/4210_Capstone_Cycle_0.pdf).

## Tasks

1. **Define the System’s Motivation**
   - Each pod will define the purpose and target audience for the touchless kiosk system. Consider questions such as:
     - Why is the system needed?
     - What problems does it solve?
     - How will it benefit users and the organization?

2. **Identify Stakeholders**
   - Pods should list potential stakeholders who will use or be impacted by the system (e.g., faculty, students, IT staff).

3. **Develop Initial User Stories**
   - Draft at least 10 user stories per pod member, using the following template:  
   - "As a [stakeholder], I want [functionality] so that [desired outcome]."  
   - Example:  
     - "As a student, I want to check my professors’ office hours so that I can plan my visits efficiently."

## Deliverables

- **Stakeholder Identification Report**: Each pod must submit a markdown file with stakeholder analyses, motivations, and user stories.
  - File naming convention: `stakeholder-[role].md`
  - Examples:
    - `stakeholder-faculty.md`
    - `stakeholder-student.md`

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the markdown file for each stakeholder in the `01-stakeholder-identification/` directory of the shared GitHub repository by the end of **Week 1**.
- Ensure that each pod member contributes at least 10 user stories, focusing either on one stakeholder in-depth or multiple stakeholders.

## Notes

- Your work in this phase sets the foundation for stakeholder interviews and user story refinement in Part 2.
- The next step will involve conducting stakeholder interviews based on your initial user stories.
