# Stakeholder Analysis Template

## Stakeholder: CSCI Student
- **Role**: CSCI students are responsible for taking classes, attending CSCI-related
events, and joining clubs that correspone with their major.

- **Needs**: CSCI students need to be able to quickly find necessary 
information about classes, CSCI-related clubs, and CSCI-related events.

- **Pain Points**: Information about CSCI-related things are currently disjointed
and not usually found in one place that's quickly accessible lowering the chance
a CSCI student will hear about it or dig deeper for more information.

- **Desired Outcomes**: A system that allows CSCI students to quickly navigate 
and become informed about a surplus of different CSCI-related things on campus

### User Story:
* "As a computer science student, I want to be able to see a calendar of upcoming
