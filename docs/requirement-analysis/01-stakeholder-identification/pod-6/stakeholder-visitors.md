# Stakeholder Analysis Template

## Stakeholder: Visitors (Prospective Students/Guests)
- **Role**: Visitors will be seeking general information about the department,
directions, contact information, etc.

- **Needs**: Visitors need to be able to quickly and easily use the touchless kiosk
to learn general information about the department and major without being overwhelmed

- **Pain Points**: Since the visitor may not be familiar at all with CSCI its
important that they can use the kiosk as easily as possible without being bombared
with information or requirements of knowledge

- **Desired Outcomes**: A system that allows Visitors (Prospective students/guests)
to access an easy-to-use interface that provides clear information about the department

### User Story:
* "As a visitor, I want to be able to navigate or be presented with a view that 
shows an overview of the CSCI department and what it has to offer so that I can
be informed about the most important information of the CSCI department."
* "As a visitor, I want to be presented with eye-catching information about the
department without even interacting with the kiosk so that I can learn information
about the department at just a glance without fully interacting with the kiosk"
* "As a visitor, I want to be able to get navigation help for the Math building
from the kiosk so that I can find where I need to go inside the building quickly

so that I can visualize where I need to go anywhere on campus."
