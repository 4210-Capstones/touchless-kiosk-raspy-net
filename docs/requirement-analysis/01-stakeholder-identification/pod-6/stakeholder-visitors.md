# Stakeholder Analysis Template

## Stakeholder: Visitors (Prospective Students/Guests)
- **Role**: Visitors will be seeking general information about the department,
directions, contact information, etc.

- **Needs**: Visitors need to be able to quickly and easily use the touchless kiosk
to learn general information about the department and major without being overwhelmed

- **Pain Points**: Since the visitor may not be familiar at all with CSCI its
important that they can use the kiosk as easily as possible without being bombared
with information or requirements of knowledge

- **Desired Outcomes**: A system that allows Visitors (Prospective students/guests)
to access an easy-to-use interface that provides clear information about the department
