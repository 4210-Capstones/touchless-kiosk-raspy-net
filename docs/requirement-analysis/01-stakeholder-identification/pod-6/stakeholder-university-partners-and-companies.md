## Stakeholder: UNO Partners/Employers
- **Role**: UNO partners with several companies and research groups to offer students research and career opportunities in their respective fields. These companies will reach out to the University to disseminate information on potential internships, job openings, research opportunities, scholarships, etc.

- **Needs**: Companies and partners need to be able to send out updates and post new opportunities for the students so that they are easily accessible in an area that is highly trafficed by the majors they are seeking.

- **Pain Points**: Since the companies would be providing updates to these opportunities via the kiosk, they would be limited to only the locations where the kiosks are available. This could present a pain point in the sense that unless kiosks are offered across all departments, they may now be pushing updates through two different mediums. 

- **Desired Outcomes**: A system that can be constantly updated by employers with new opportunities and would be accessible to all targeted majors for an easy to use interface with constant opportunities for the students in the desired field.
