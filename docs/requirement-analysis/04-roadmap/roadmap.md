# Roadmap Development (Part 4)

## Overview

In Part 4 of the **Capstone Project: Roadmap Development**, each pod will break down the features identified in Part 3 into incremental development cycles. These cycles will outline milestones, sprints, and tasks necessary to complete the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and subsequent system features. The roadmap will serve as a structured guide for how the system will be developed and delivered over time.

For detailed instructions, you can access the full Cycle 0 document [here](https://github.com/4210-Capstones/4210-course-resources/blob/main/Capstone/4210_Capstone_Cycle_0.pdf).

## Tasks

1. **Identify Systems and Define Development Cycles**
   - Each pod will analyze the requirements and features identified in Part 3, grouping them into **shared systems** (e.g., authentication) and **user-specific systems** (e.g., tutor management).
   - Break down the systems into incremental **cycles**, each with specific goals (e.g., MVP, high-priority features, etc.).

2. **Define Milestones, Sprints, and Tasks**
   - For each system and cycle, define the key **milestones** to be achieved.
   - Organize the milestones into smaller, time-boxed **sprints**.
   - Each sprint should consist of specific **tasks** necessary to complete the milestone, with difficulty and priority ratings.

3. **Map Features to Development Cycles**
   - Use the feature list from Part 3 to assign features to each cycle based on priority and complexity.
   - Clearly indicate which milestones and features are part of the MVP.

4. **Create the Roadmap Document**
   - Document the roadmap, detailing systems, milestones, sprints, and tasks. This document will serve as the basis for ongoing project tracking in future cycles.

## Deliverables

- **Roadmap Document**: Each pod must submit a markdown file that outlines their roadmap, including cycles, milestones, sprints, and tasks.
  - File naming convention: `roadmap-pod-[number].md`
  - Examples:
    - `roadmap-pod-1.md`
    - `roadmap-pod-2.md`

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the markdown file for your roadmap in the `04-roadmap/` directory of the shared GitHub repository by the end of **Week 4**.
- Be sure to include both shared and user-specific systems, with clear milestones, sprints, and tasks for each cycle.

## Notes

- The roadmap will guide the remaining project development phases and will be used to track progress on the GitHub Project board in Part 5.
- Make sure to prioritize tasks based on the MVP and subsequent high-priority features.
