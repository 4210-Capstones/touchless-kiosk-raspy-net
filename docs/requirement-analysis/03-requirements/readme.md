# Requirements Document & Feature Prioritization (Part 3)

## Overview

In Part 3 of the **Capstone Project: Requirements Document & Feature Prioritization**, each pod will compile a comprehensive list of system requirements based on stakeholder feedback from Part 2. This includes both functional and non-functional requirements, prioritizing features by importance and difficulty. Pods will also identify the core features that will form the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

For detailed instructions, you can access the full Cycle 0 document [here](https://github.com/4210-Capstones/4210-course-resources/blob/main/Capstone/4210_Capstone_Cycle_0.pdf).

## Tasks

1. **Complete the Requirements Document**
   - Each pod must finalize the functional and non-functional requirements for the touchless kiosk system.
     - **Functional requirements**: Specific behaviors or functions the system must support.
     - **Non-functional requirements**: Quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, etc.

2. **Compile, Prioritize, and Assess Feature Difficulty**
   - Create a comprehensive feature list based on refined user stories from Part 2.
     - **Priority levels**: Critical (must-have), High (should-have), Medium (could-have), and Low (nice-to-have).
     - **Difficulty**: Label each feature as Easy, Medium, or Hard.

3. **Identify MVP Features**
   - Select the core features essential for delivering a functional product (MVP), prioritizing critical features that are easier to implement.

## Deliverables

- **Requirements Document**: Each pod must submit a markdown file containing the finalized functional and non-functional requirements, prioritized feature list, and difficulty assessments.
  - File naming convention: `[system-name].md`
  - Examples:
    - `Tutor-System.md`
    - `Student-System.md`
  
## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the markdown file for your requirements document and feature prioritization in the `03-requirements/` directory of the shared GitHub repository by the end of **Week 3**.
- Ensure that each pod clearly prioritizes the features and identifies the MVP features.

## Notes

- The requirements document will form the basis for the roadmap development in Part 4.
- Be thorough in identifying priorities and difficulties, as they will guide task assignments and scheduling in future phases.
