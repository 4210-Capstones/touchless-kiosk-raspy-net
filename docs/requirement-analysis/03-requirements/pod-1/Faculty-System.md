## 3. **Feature List, Prioritization, and Difficulty**:
### **Critical Features** (MVP)
- **Important Dates Display**: Keeping students informed about key academic dates such as midterms, project deadlines, and event reminders is crucial for their academic planning and success. By being consistently aware of upcoming events and deadlines, students are more likely to participate in departmental activities, leading to a more engaged and cohesive student community. (Priority: Critical, Difficulty: Medium)

- **Office Hours Broadcast**: Broadcasting faculty office hours makes it easier for students to know when professors are available, encouraging them to seek help, ask questions, and engage in academic discussions outside of class time. This feature reduces the communication gap that often exists due to scheduling conflicts or misaligned expectations, ensuring that students can efficiently plan their visits to faculty offices. (Priority: Critical, Difficulty: Medium)

### **High Priority Features**
- **Department/Campus Map**: A map of the department and/or campus can be invaluable to new students, visitors, or students visiting for the first time. (Priority: High, Difficulty: Medium)

### **Low Priority Features**
- **Student Project Showcase**: By displaying student projects, the kiosk celebrates achievements and hardwork, which will hopefully spark inspiration/motivation around the department. Regularly updated content gives students a reason to interact with the kiosk daily, increasing its utility and presence in their routines. (Priority: Low, Difficulty: Low)

- **Daily Quotes/Puzzles**: Inspirational quotes or engaging puzzles can uplift students' spirits, especially during stressful periods like exams. (Priority: Low, Difficulty: Low)

- **Virtual Wall for Notes and Announcements**: A virtual space for notes and messages helps build a sense of community, allowing students to share encouragement, advice, or announcements. Basically a "physical" Discord. Students can post about study groups, club meetings, or lost-and-found items, facilitating peer-to-peer communication. (Priority: Low, Difficulty: Medium (Moderation))

- **Games**: Short, entertaining games offer a quick break from academic pressures, helping students relax and recharge. Games developed with motion sensors in mind can be fun projects for game development classes, providing practical experience for students. (Priority: Low, Difficulty: Varies)
