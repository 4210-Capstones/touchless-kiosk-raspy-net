# [Public System] Requirements Document
## 1. Functional Requirements
- **Gesture controls:** Allow for basic hardware interactrion via touchless 
    controls.
- **Important functions:** Mute, shut down, app select. Would probably require 
    root acess to the device   
## 2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Quick response:** May not want extremly delayed tracking for mouse controls.
- **Alt-tab function**: Would allow for quick switching between apps.

## 3. Feature List, Prioritization, and Difficulty
### Critical Features (MVP)
- **Gesture controls**: The user can control the kiosk with either their hand 
    or wrist, allow it to be used as a cursor. (Priority: Critical, Difficulty: Hard)

### High Priority Features
- **Important control functions**:Goes in-tandum with gesture controls. Could 
    be a special menu to prevent accidental trigger. (Priority: Critical, Difficulty: Medium)

### Medium Priority Features
- **Quick response:** Essential for ease-of-use. Ideally a delay similar to a 
    mouse, at max, 1 second. (Priority: High, Difficulty: Hard)

### Low Priority Features
- **Alt-tab function**: Would help with ease-of-use and functionality, with 
    better smoothness the better user-experience will be. (Priority: Low, Difficulty: Medium)
