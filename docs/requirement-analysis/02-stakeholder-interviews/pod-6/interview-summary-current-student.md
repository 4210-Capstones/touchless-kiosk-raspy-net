# Stakeholder Interview Summary

## Stakeholder: Current Student
- **Interview Date**: October 13, 2024
- **Interviewee**: Student Stakeholder (Justin Nguyen)

### Key Insights:
- **Essential Features**:  
  1. The student expressed a need for easier access to information about campus club meetings, such as the ACM club. They suggested that displaying this information on campus TVs would be more convenient than relying solely on the UNO CSCI Discord.
  2. The student would like the touchless kiosk system to allow them to schedule meetings with professors. They also want the system to display live information on professor availability, such as booked meeting times.

- **Pain Points**:  
  1. Difficulty in keeping up with campus events (specifically club meetings) when the information is only available through Discord.
  2. Scheduling meetings with professors is currently inefficient, as there is no easy way to check a professor's availability in real-time.

- **Insights**:  
  1. The suggestion to use campus TVs as an information source highlights the need for multiple, easily accessible communication channels for students to stay informed about campus events.
  2. The request for a feature to view live professor availability indicates that students value real-time access to schedules and a streamlined process for setting up appointments.

- **Workflow Integration**:  
  The student envisions using the kiosk system as a central hub for accessing important campus information. They would use it to stay updated on club activities (via on-campus displays) and to manage academic appointments efficiently (by checking professor availability and booking meetings directly).
