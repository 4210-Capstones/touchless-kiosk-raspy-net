# Stakeholder Interview Summary
## Stakeholder: U.N.O. Research Partner
* **Interview Date:** October 11, 2024
* **Interviewee:** Dr. Abdullah Al Redwan Newaz (Autonomous Intelligent Robotics Lab)
### Key Insights
* **Essential Features:**
    * An essential feature that Dr. Redwan would like to see from the kiosk is an interface that can provide anyone with more information about the Autonomous Intelligent Robotics Lab, such as ongoing research, demo videos, and a form for interested parties to fill out to join the group. He also suggested potentially incorporating some kind of capability to receive data as input in order to interact in a simulated environment with one of the robots that they are developing.
* **Pain Points:**
    * Currently, in order to show the videos of the demos that the AIR Lab has put together, they need a presenter to play the videos which can be difficult to coordinate.
    * Information regarding the research group is mainly available through their website, but if someone doesn't know about the group, it's difficult to showcase their research and demos as well as finding new participants.
    * Showcasing demos of the robotics is not practical given that it's difficult to move the robots to where they would like to conduct the demo. 
* **Insights:**
    * The suggestion for an interactive hub for the research lab to disseminate information highlights the need for an easily accesible medium that students, faculty members, and interested parties can access the group's information.
    * The suggestion to be able to play on-demand videos and demos of the research group indicate that there is a need in the ability to streamline the process of providing such videos and demos without the need to coordinate with a presenter and making it more accessible to people.
    * The suggestion of providing an interactive hub that reads data from the user highlights the difficulty in transporting robotics, thus creating a more accessible and intereactive demo that would not usually be available.
* **Workflow Integration:**
    * The AIR Lab envisions the kiosk system as an interactive point that would allow them to present their findings much more easily and available to more people while also being able to showcase their current research to many more people.
