# Stakeholder Interview Summary
## Stakeholder: Professor
- **Interview Date**: 10/11/2024
- **Interviewee**: Dr. Ben Samuel
### Key Insights:
- **Essential Features**: 
	- Highlight important dates, like midterms or project deadlines, on the kiosk so that students can be constantly reminded.
	- Broadcast office hours for students to see when professors are available
	- Show off projects that students have worked on whether it be games, apps, software, etc.
	- A Map of the department showing where classes and offices are located.

- *Slightly Less Essential (Long-term thinking) Features*
	- Daily quotes/puzzles to increase engagement
		- Think of how Wordle is played once a day
		- "Daily dose of delight"
	- Collaboration
		- An interactive story-building feature, where students can contribute sentences to create a collective story.
		- A virtual "wall" where students can leave notes, announcements, or encouragement for one another.
	- Games
		- Flappy bird
		- Fruit Ninja
		- Game Dev class/IGDA projects made with the motion sensor in mind.
		- High score list drives friendly competition in the department.
- **Pain Points**: 
	- In order for this to be viable, the kiosk will have to actually be attractive and have enough incentive for people to want to keep the information on it fresh and update to date.
	- If "wall" feature/collaboration features are implemented, moderation may be needed.
- **Insights**: 
	- Having the department interact with it to collaborate on leaving notes, find new clubs, see leaderboards, etc. can motivate students to interact more.
- **Workflow Integration**: 
	- Broadcasting office hours, class projects, club meeting dates/times, events, etc.
### Refined User Stories:

- As a faculty member, I want to broadcast my office hours on the kiosk so that students know when I'm available, improving accessibility and reducing the number of email inquiries."
- As a faculty member, I want to display student projects (with permission), such as games, apps, or other coursework, to celebrate student achievements and inspire other students to engage with department activities.
