# Stakeholder Interview Summary
## Stakeholder: Stakeholder Role
- **Interview Date**: 10/8/24
- **Interviewee**: Student1
### Key Insights:
- **Essential Features**: Mute, power off, channel/ app selection via gestures.
- **Pain Points**: The need to reach for a remote or interacting with the TV manually would defeat the point of a touchless kiosk. It'd be more like the current limitations of the TV's set up.
- **Insights**: Guestures to function as shortcuts would probably require some direct root acess with the TV. We would need to look at what's feasable with the hardware limitations.
- **Workflow Integration**:  It saves a lot of time in every aspect to not need a mouse or a remote for every little thing. Like switching between slides or be it changing the programs.
### Refined User Stories:
1. "As a [student], I want [gestures] so that [it will be easy to use the kiosk]."
