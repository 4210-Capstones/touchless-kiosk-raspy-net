# Stakeholder: Transfer Student 
- **Interview Date:** 10/11/2024
- **Interviewee:** Victoria Pham

## Key Insights
- **Essential Features:** Victoria is highly interested in a searchable database for academic advisors, instructors, student organizations, course catalogs, research opportunities, and internships, complete with contact details. Furthermore, she would like to see real-time information on which classrooms are in use and which are available. A touchless map to help students navigate campus, especially the buildings, would be a valuable resource.
- **Pain Points:** There is an information overload when transfer students are trying to integrate into student life, so simplifying access to information for new students would should be less intimidating. There should be a better way to streamline how students reach out to advisors and faculty to reduce frustration. Additionally, providing information on available study rooms or meeting spaces on campus would be helpful.
- **Insights:** Transfer students often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information provided and would benefit from a step-by-step guide to accessing resources. Visual aids and directories, such as images of faculty and staff, would enhance identification and communication.
- **Workflow Integration:** The kiosk should integrate guidance on contacting academic advisors and instructors, an overview of the floorplan of the building as well as provide a directory of student organizations in the CSCI department.
