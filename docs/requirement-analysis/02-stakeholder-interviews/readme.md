# Stakeholder Interviews (Part 2)

## Overview

In Part 2 of the **Capstone Project: Stakeholder Interviews**, each pod will conduct interviews with the stakeholders identified in Part 1. The goal is to refine user stories and gather deeper insights into stakeholder needs, challenges, and expectations. This step is crucial for validating the initial assumptions and refining the system’s requirements.

## Tasks

1. **Schedule Stakeholder Interviews**
   - Each pod will conduct 2-3 interviews with unique stakeholders identified in Part 1.
   - Interviews should focus on gathering information about essential features, pain points, and workflow integration.

2. **Conduct Stakeholder Interviews**
   - During the interviews, focus on:
     - What specific features or functionalities the stakeholders consider essential.
     - Pain points that could be addressed by the system.
     - Insights or new ideas not considered during the initial user story creation.
     - How the system could integrate into the stakeholder's workflow.

3. **Summarize Interview Insights**
   - After the interviews, each pod must summarize the findings and insights from each stakeholder.
   - Focus on key features, challenges, and any new considerations that emerged.

4. **Refine User Stories**
   - Use the interview feedback to adjust the user stories:
     - Remove irrelevant stories.
     - Add new stories to address unanticipated needs.
     - Modify existing stories based on stakeholder feedback.

## Deliverables

- **Interview Summary Report**: Each pod must submit a markdown file summarizing the key insights from each stakeholder interview.
  - File naming convention: `interview-summary-[role].md`
  - Examples:
    - `interview-summary-faculty.md`
    - `interview-summary-it-staff.md`

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the interview summaries and refined user stories in the `02-stakeholder-interviews/` directory of the shared GitHub repository by the end of **Week 2**.
- Ensure that each pod documents their findings thoroughly, as they will inform the next phase of requirements development.

## Notes

- The insights gathered in this phase will help refine the project’s requirements, which will be compiled into a full requirements document in Part 3.
- Be sure to track the interview tasks on the GitHub Project board.
