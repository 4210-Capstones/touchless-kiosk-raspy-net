# Stakeholder Interview Summary
## Stakeholder: [Stakeholder Role]
- **Interview Date**: 10/10/2024
- **Interviewee**: David Pace
### Key Insights:
- **Essential Features**: David is highly interested in a home widget board that provides easy single-click access to items such as
		- Student projects
		-  Current research
		- Student project submissions (including projects completed during their free time and passion projects).
- **Pain Points**: Difficulty in keeping the items on these lists up-to-date automatically. A possible solution could be a web portal where submissions are reviewed and approved.
- **Insights**: The submission of student passion projects was not previously considered and could provide valuable visibility.
- **Workflow Integration**: David sees this tool as not only a way to convey information about departmental activities but also for making announcements. As the CS IT Director, he also expressed interest in displaying relevant network data.
