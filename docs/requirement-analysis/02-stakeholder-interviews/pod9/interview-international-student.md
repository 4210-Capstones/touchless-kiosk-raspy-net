## Stakeholder: International Student
- **Interview Date**: [October 8, 2024]

### Key Insights:
- **Essential Features**:
  - Unified app to manage campus life (professor communication, schedules, building maps).
  - A map of campus buildings with information about offices and professor rooms.
  - Weekly cafeteria menus that are accessible and up-to-date.
  - Centralized access to class-related resources (deadlines, tasks, exam schedules) in a single app instead of multiple apps.
  - Better communication methods with teachers and peers.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Navigating multiple apps (e.g., Workday, Canvas) is frustrating, especially for organizing class-related tasks.
  - Difficulty in finding professor contact details and office locations.
  - The cafeteria menu is inaccessible, and students can’t plan meals in advance.
  - Lack of structured orientation or introduction to campus services.
  - Communication with peers is limited (WhatsApp isn’t used widely).
  - Uncertainty about who to approach for help with safety concerns (or general information inquiries).
- **Insights**:
  - A centralized app could improve campus experience, reducing the need for multiple systems.
  - Peer-to-peer communication seems to be a challenge; some system or feature could address that gap.
  - Orientation and campus navigation are crucial for new students, especially international ones.
- **Workflow Integration**:
  - The stakeholder envisions using the system not only on TVs but also on personal devices, such as smartphones, for flexibility and better access to essential information throughout the day.
  - Daily use for checking schedules, finding locations, and accessing cafeteria menus.
