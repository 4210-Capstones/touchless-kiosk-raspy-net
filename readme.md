# CSCI 4210 Capstone Project: Touchless Kiosk System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Capstone Project** for CSCI 4210: Software Engineering. This project aims to develop a **Touchless Kiosk System** that will provide students, faculty, and staff with hands-free access to information using cutting-edge technologies.

The project is broken into multiple phases (Cycles), starting from stakeholder identification to requirements gathering, roadmap development, and final implementation.

## Project Phases

0. **Cycle 0: Requirements Analysis and Roadmapping**
   - Part 1: Stakeholder Identification
   - Part 2: Stakeholder Interviews
   - Part 3: Requirements Document & Feature Prioritization
   - Part 4: Roadmap Development

1. **Cycle 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
   - Core features necessary to make the system functional.

2. **Cycle 2: High-Priority Features**
   - Features that enhance user experience and functionality.

3. **Cycle 3: Medium & Low-Priority Features**
   - Additional features that improve the system's performance and capabilities.

4. **Cycle 4: Postmortem and Demo**
   - Conduct a project postmortem to evaluate successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.
   - Deliver a live demo showcasing the final product and its features.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each corresponding to a different part of the project:

- `01-stakeholder-identification/`: Documentation for identifying stakeholders and initial user stories.
- `02-stakeholder-interviews/`: Interview summaries and refined user stories.
- `03-requirements/`: Finalized requirements and feature prioritization.
- `04-roadmap/`: Roadmap with cycles, milestones, sprints, and tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4210-Capstones/4210-course-resources.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for your current phase (e.g., `01-stakeholder-identification/`) and follow the instructions provided in the relevant `readme.md` file.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Each pod is responsible for their assigned tasks, and all work should be submitted via pull requests.
- Please follow the naming conventions for files and submit your work in the correct directories.
- Regularly update the GitHub Project board with your tasks and progress.
